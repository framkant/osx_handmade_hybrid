osx_handmade_hybrid
===================

This is the start of a minimal OSX application that could serve as a basis for a platform layer for "Handmade Hero". A project developed by Casey Muratori. Please read more at handmadehero.org

My main purpose of doing this is that I want a robust and simple base layer for mac and I feel that there are no obvious good approaches that I know of at the moment.

The idea here is to set up things in xcode (once) and then leave it be and do the rest work from command line using simple build scripts and a text editor.

There are at least two mayor approaches: Embracing Xcode or do everything programmatically.

Jeff Buck has two good examples:
First an example of using cocoa through xcode tools in a "typical" way
https://github.com/itfrombit/osx_handmade/tree/master/handmade
and programmatical approach

Arthur Langereis has another alternative that is more like what I'm doing here
https://github.com/zenmumbler/handmade-alt-proto

Please go take a look at them all.
