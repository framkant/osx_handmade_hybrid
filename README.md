osx_handmade_hybrid
===================

This is the start of a minimal OSX application that could serve as a basis for a platform layer for "Handmade Hero". A project developed by Casey Muratori. Please read more at handmadehero.org

The idea here is to set up things in xcode and then leave it be and do the rest work from command line.

This is an experiment. There are at least two other mayor approaches: Embracing Xcode or do everything programmatically.

Jeff Buck has two good examples:
